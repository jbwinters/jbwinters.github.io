WIP: Below is a collection of various thoughts I've had over the last few months. I aim to organize them into a coherent essay.

Coding is writing a story that does something. It starts out small with very particular instructions flipping very particular bits, but the effects of automation bloom rapidly. It takes as much effort to write ten-thousand instructions as it does one million. It is a force multiplier, and an art.

My design motif is much like the actor paradigm. Individuals communicate with each other. How do they best communicate to accomplish a particular task? What information should they share and not share? What happens if one individual leaves unexpectedly? And what if they come back?

I describe where information comes from, who it goes to, and how it's transferred and transformed. I look at systems around me and see how they best fit together - what would be most stable. Stability to me is beautiful, and this aesthetic is one I've acquired only through coding.

Often the act of coding in itself is tedious and dull. At best I can find ways to write less code, typically through application of previously written code. I have a minimum bound of tedium I must endure. My memory only works so well, and I must learn better tools to improve my craft. 

My search process is thus: look for possible improvements over time, and only fix those problems which underly many others. Course-correcting to underlying problems solves many problems at once and sails you further into the future. Tour search is constrained only by the tools you use to shape your environment; a bulldozer gets you further than a shovel. Force multipliers are the only tools worth building. Everything else is minutae. Your mastery of information is honed into a fine chisel, which cleaves the stone of multitude one stroke at a time.

A true artist observes the whole while creating the parts. And so I must with code and the product it creates. In which ways is it to be valuable? Which problems should I pay the most attention to? From inside I look out and see which issues are blocking me from seeing reality. The more truth I know of reality, the more clearly I see. Knowing reality allows me to better course-correct. Knowing reality makes me stronger. I can anticipate and avoid more obstacles, solve bigger problems.

Skill allows me to appreciate other areas of my life. With mindfulness I can translate that appreciation into further course correction and so on. Thus it gives me the core mental tools to grow as a human.

It is often easier to think in pictures. A massively parallel graphics processor operates much more effectively on a certain class of problems than a single methodical calculator. The calculator is best at planning, and the graphics processor is best at relating. Both flavor their relations with their state. We are the brain unraveling. We are the brain creating, ,however we can, in our fight for survival.

We'd keep it all inside to most purely observe, but find outselves bursting with residual energy from processes which release more energy than we put in. We must create. Creation is an interaction, even if only between pen and paper, and if we do not interact we will perish. And anyway, there comes a time when all has been learned from a current frame of reference, and effort must be made to find a better one with more to teach. The unravelling propels us. It enforces order and consideration. It guides us to stability.

The desire for truth is hard sometimes. Being wrong hurts and learning truth requires being wrong often. I can guide someone to the truth as best I can, but if someone knows more then I can be swept along, bumping into rough truths along the way.

Typically my confidence is the first false truth to go. If I am not totally confident I am correct, I can lag or fall behind a leader. As of late, however, I have lowered my threshold for confidence, or perhaps confidence in my skill has been raised. I do not become dejected when wrong as I used to. I expect it no and use it toward my course-correction. Were I to not expect is and not learn from it I would be arrogant.

The deeper parts of my mind know better than me. That is what I know. I can observe them through their actions and interact with them by nourishing them, aiding them in their abstract search for stability. I observe and decipher deeper mearning. I feed them what they ask for. I listen, whenever possible I look for the underlying requests. I address those. I course-correct. I multiply my output and stabilize my surroundings. They and I are distinct, seperate, and communicate through osmosis. Yet we are one; we function as a unit. That knowledge is my confidence. I can relax and I will do well because experience backs me up.
