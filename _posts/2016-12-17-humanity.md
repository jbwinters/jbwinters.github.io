And here we find a great swirling machine, noise, mystery. We find movement, repulsion, attraction, stability and chaos. Complication belying order. What is the order? Deeper complication. Greater complexity. Seemingly random. Yet looking further down, we find more order. More complexity. More. More.

And here we are, in the middle of this mess. We must drink to eat. We must eat to sleep. We must sleep to stay sane. We must stay sane to communicate. We must communicate to socialize. We must socialize to cooperate. We must cooperate to sustain. We must sustain to drink. It doesn't end. Even in death we play our parts in time, in the movement of particles from one place to another, in the continuation of our complicated little worlds built on complexity. In the creation of new complexity.
